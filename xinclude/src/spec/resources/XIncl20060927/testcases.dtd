Typical use : 	<DOCTYPE test-suite SYSTEM "testcases.dtd">
Purpose:	To collect test cases for submission to the Xinclude Test Suite.


Elements:
	testsuite : 		This is the root element of the XInclude test suite. It is a collection of testcases from 
				various test suppliers.
	
	testcases:		This element should be the root element for an individual test collection. 

	contributor: 		This element can be used to name test contributors at the
				individual-person level.

	date: 			Date stamp on the testcase. Identifies date of creation or modification in the "qualifier" 
				argument.

	testcase: 		An individual test in the test collection. It should provide with the following elements;
				description, section, contributor, date and output

	section:		This element contains the resource argument to Point to the relevant sections in the specification. Provides a mechanism 
				for examining the description element.  Tests can apply to one or more particular SECTIONS.

	description:		Contains the test description, used to evaluate the diagnostic produced on negative
				tests. People will generally read this to evaluate whether the test failed for the 
				correct reasons (when applicable). This description will be used by the test system to be included in 
				the tables of test cases.
	
	output:			Output file (result-infoset) as expected by the submitter. This is an optional element 
				for informational purposes only. 

Attributes:
	creator:		This argument provides with the test collection originator.
	(tescases attribute)

	basedir:		This argument is the base directory in which tests for this collection reside.
            		
	href:			Test name or reference to an individual test.
	 			
	id:			
	("test-case" 
	attribute)		Unique identifier for each test case.

        features:		Any optional features that this test requires.
                                Implementations not supporting a feature should
				skip the test.  Values are:
		xpointer-scheme:     requires the xpointer scheme
		unexpanded-entities: requires the parser to not expand external
		                     entities
		unparsed-entities:   requires unparsed entity support
		lang-fixup:          requires xml:lang fixup support

	qualifier:		Indicates date of creation or modification of the test.

	resource:		Pointer to the applicable section of the specification.,
	("section" attribute)

    The TESTRESULT element is used to record test results.
	It has a required ID attribute which identifies the TEST.
	It has a required AGREEMENT attribute that indicates whether
	the results are in full agreement with the expected
	results as described in the TEST case or not.

    The textual contents of the TESTRESULT element should describe
	the results of the test and any issues or further information.

    The target of the optional RESULTS attribute could be an XML Infoset

    The optional FUTURESUPPORT attribute is used to indicate
	expected future support of the feature tested by this
	test case.  

    The optional SPECPROBLEM attribute indicates if there is
	any ambiguity or other problem found in the spec that relates
	to this test.  Especially if the results weren't as expected
	because of a misinterpretation of the spec, this should be
	documented here.  Details/discussion should appear in the 
	textual contents of the TESTRESULT element.

    The optional TESTPROBLEM attribute indicates if there is
	any issue with the TEST case and the expected results it
	suggests.  Especially if the results of the test differ
	from that given as "expected" by the test case but are,
	in fact, believed to be the correct results, this should
	be documented here.  Details/discussion should appear in the 
	textual contents of the TESTRESULT element.

<h1 align="center"><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude">XInclude</a> Test Suite</h1>
<p> This is the CVS base used to maintain the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Test/XInclude/Overview.html">test suite</a>
for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude">XInclude</a> specification.
<p> The file <em>testdescr.xml</em> describes the set of primary
resources used by the test suite, the sections of the specification
that are being checked, the author and date of each test. It also
provide whether the test should fail with a fatal error or points
to a result file if this is not the case. Please note that while
we expect the testsuite to accurately reflect the XInclude specification
it is not normative and may change if errors are found.
<p> For more informations on the test suite or to download a packaged
version of the tests, please visit the

test suite page</a>.
